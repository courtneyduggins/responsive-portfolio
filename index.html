        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="http://alliswall.com/file/11124/1920x1200/16:9/seychelles_beautiful_beach_hd_wallpaper.jpg" id="ProPic"alt="Beach">

        <p> I currently work as a Commercial Insurance Underwriter at The Hartford Financial Services Company. I started working
            for the company in 2013 after I graduated Cum Laude from the University of San Antonio at Texas, where I obtained
            my Bachelor's Degree in Actuarial Science combined with a Minor in Applied Statistics. I am from Texas, but currently
            reside in Charlotte, North Carolina.
        </p>

        <p>After getting my feet wet working in my first cororate position, I quickly realized how critical a role technoology
            plays in allowing companies to compete in today's market place. As a result, I have become passionate about expanding
            my knowledge base in order to keep up with the eloving technological needs of the furture. In order to have a
            more hands-on deverloper/programming role, I enrolled in a 6-month Full-Stack Web Development course with The
            University of North Carolina - Charlotte's extended education program to learn about web development. At the
            end of the course, I plan to have obtained enough knowledge and skill in order to secure a poistion as a Junior
            Web Developer.
        </p>

        <p> When I'm not sctraching my head trying to figure out why my code isn't working and/or selling insurance policies,
            I enjoy traveling with my family and friends. My most recent trip was to D.C. to tour the National Museum of
            African American History, if you haven't been you should definietely go, truly awesome and humbling experience.
            I also enjoy olunteering with my church small group at a few of the local charities here in Charlotte and engaging
            in various wellness activities such such as boxing, hiking, etc. I love listening to music and I am also avid
            reader. (I'm currently working on my first novel!) Overall, I would say I am very ambitious, tenacious, and optimistic
            about what the future holds.
